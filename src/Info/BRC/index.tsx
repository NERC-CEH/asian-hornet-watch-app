              <li>
                Sent to the Biological Record Centreâ€™s data warehouse linked to
                the iRecord system where it is accessible to you as the
                recorder, to an expert community of verifiers and other users of

                Quality assured data is passed onto Local Environmental Records

            (BRC), established in 1964, is a national focus in the UK for
            terrestrial and freshwater species recording. BRC works closely with
            the voluntary recording community, principally through support of
            national recording schemes and societies. BRC is supported by the
            Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) and the Centre for
            Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) within the Natural Environment Research
            Council (NERC). The work of BRC is a major component of the National
            Biodiversity Network (NBN).

              BRC apps

            feature some of the same species? We have introduced the BRC
            Approved logo to signify that data from our apps all go to the same
            place. Therefore, you are free to choose which app you use to record
            a given species. All records will be sent to the same place, treated
            in the same way and will meet the established standards required by
            the Biological Record Centre.
