    <p><strong>About BRC</strong></p>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://www.brc.ac.uk" rel="external">Biological Records Centre</a> (BRC), established in 1964, is a national
      focus in the UK for terrestrial and freshwater species recording.
      BRC works closely with the voluntary recording community, principally
      through support of national recording schemes and societies. BRC is
      supported by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) and the
      Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) within the Natural Environment
      Research Council (NERC). The work of BRC is a major component of the
      National Biodiversity Network (NBN).</p>

    <p><strong>Which app should I use?</strong></p>

    <p>You might have noticed that several of
      <a href="http://www.brc.ac.uk/apps" rel="external">BRC apps</a>
      feature some of the same species?  We have introduced the BRC Approved
      logo to signify that data from our apps all go to the same place.
      Therefore, you are free to choose which app you use to record a given species.
      All records will be sent to the same place, treated in the same way and will meet
      the established standards required by the Biological  Record Centre.</p>
