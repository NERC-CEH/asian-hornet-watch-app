      Asian Hornet Watch is an app designed to record and help the early detection of
      Asian Hornet in the UK following the first confirmed record in September 2016.
      Asian Hornet is a non-native species within the UK and could have a serious impact
      on our wild insects and honeybees so early detection is important. There are a number
      of native insects in the UK that look very similar to the Asian Hornet, and are common
      and widespread. Asian Hornet Watch provides an identification guide to help check
      which species you have seen and an opportunity to record your sightings. Insect
      identification can be difficult and so please do include a photograph with your
      record to help us confirm the identity of the species you have seen.
