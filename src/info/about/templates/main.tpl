      Hornet Watch is an app designed to record and help the early detection of Asian Hornet
      in the UK following the first confirmed record in September 2016. Asian Hornet is a
      non-native species within the UK and could have a serious impact on our native insects
      and honeybees so early detection is important. There are a number of native insects
      in the UK that look very similar, and are common and widespread. Records of these species
      are equally welcome to help map their distribution and Hornet Watch provides an
      identification guide to help determine which species you have seen. Please do include a
      photograph with your record if possible to help us confirm the identity of the species.
